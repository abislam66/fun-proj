          TuEats is a small, community-built guide to food trucks and other
          off-meal-plan food around Temple University&apos;s main campus.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Why it exists</h2>
          <p>
            Campus food changes quickly. A familiar cart moves, posted hours
            drift, and a great lunch can hide one block away. TuEats puts the
            useful details in one place: where to go, what kind of food is
            there, and whether it is usually open.

          <h2>How the information works</h2>
          <p>
            Listings are curated and periodically checked. Hours are always a
            guide, not a promise. If something looks wrong, use the report link
            on the venue page so it can be checked.
          </p>

          <h2>Signing in</h2>
          <p>
            Browsing the map, search, and filters never requires an account.
            Opening a specific place&rsquo;s full page does, using Google
            sign-in through Supabase. We only ever see your name and email from
            Google to create your account &mdash; your email is never shown to
            anyone or stored outside of authentication, and your Google password
            is never seen by TuEats at all.

          <h2>Cookies &amp; analytics</h2>
          <p>
            We use a cookie only to keep you signed in &mdash; neither analytics
            tool we use sets one. Vercel Web Analytics just counts page views.
            PostHog counts page views too, and also records clicks and a handful
            of specific actions &mdash; which filters you use, when you view or
            select a place, and if you rate a place, add a photo, or report a
            problem &mdash; to help us see what&rsquo;s actually useful. It
            never records what you type: a masked session replay may capture how
            you move through the site, but every typed value (search, reviews,
            report notes) is replaced with a placeholder before it ever leaves
            your browser. None of this runs on our internal admin tools. Both
            analytics tools stay fully anonymous &mdash; no account id, display
            name, or email ever reaches either &mdash; and PostHog is further
            configured to discard IP addresses and skip location lookups. There
            are no advertising trackers on TuEats.
